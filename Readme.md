# Apollo Query Plan Analyzer (QP Analyzer)

This CLI tool can be used to predict how GraphQL queries may be planned by Apollo Router.

This repository is maintained by Apollo GraphQL's Federation Core team.

## Overview

### Background

In order to accurately predict the behavior of a query on Apollo Router, it is necessary to compute the correct query plan as it will be computed on Router. However, the reality is that it is not just one single query plan, it’s actually a number of possible query plans that could be generated, since both the Router (via progressive override states and coprocessors) and the client (via authentication) can influence how query plans are calculated.

### Goal

Currently, this tool can enumerate all possible combinations of (progressive) override labels and generate query plans for all of them. Since each progressive override label can be turned on or off individually, the number of combinations will be $2^n$, where $n$ is the number of labels.

### Limitations

There are several other factors that can influence generated query plans as following. However, this CLI tool does not consider the effects of those.

* Authentication policy may remove certain selections from the input query.
  - This CLI tool assumes all selections are allowed.
  - Note: Removal of one or more selections may change the generated query plan significantly.
* Router’s plugins and coprocessors may control the progressive overrides.
  - Note: Not all combinations of overrides that are generated by this CLI tool may actually be feasible.

## Build

Prerequisite: Rust toolchain (latest stable version recommended)

- To install Rust, please follow instructions on https://rust-lang.org/tools/install/.

Execute the following `cargo` command to build:
```
cargo build --release
```

The `qp-analyzer` binary will be produced under `target/release` directory.

## Usage

```
Usage: qp-analyzer <COMMAND>

Commands:
  list-overrides  List all override condition labels in supergraph schema
  plan            Plan all possible query plans for supergraph schema and query
  plan-one        Plan a query plan for supergraph schema, query and override conditions
  help            Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
  -h, --help  Print help
```

### `list-overrides` command

Lists all override condition labels in the supergraph schema.

```
Usage: qp-analyzer list-overrides <SCHEMA>

Arguments:
  <SCHEMA>  Path to the supergraph schema file
```

#### Example

Command line:
```
% qp-analyzer list-overrides example/supergraph.graphql
```

Console output:
```
percent(50)
percent(90)
```

### `plan` command

Plans all possible query plans for a given schema and query.

```
Usage: qp-analyzer plan [OPTIONS] <SCHEMA> <QUERY>

Arguments:
  <SCHEMA>  Path to the supergraph schema file
  <QUERY>   Path to the query file, `-` for stdin

Options:
      --json
          Output results in JSON format
      --disable-generate-query-fragments
          Disable optimization of subgraph fetch queries using fragments
      --disable-defer-support
          Disable defer support
      --experimental-type-conditioned-fetching
          Enable type conditioned fetching
      --experimental-plans-limit <EXPERIMENTAL_PLANS_LIMIT>
          Sets a limit to the number of generated query plans [default: 10000]
      --experimental-paths-limit <EXPERIMENTAL_PATHS_LIMIT>
          Specify a per-path limit to the number of options considered. No limit is applied by default. Also, if set to `0`, it is treated as no limit [default: 0]
```

#### Example

Command line:
```
% qp-analyzer plan example/supergraph.graphql example/op.graphql
```

Console output:
```
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Override Combination #0: []
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
QueryPlan {
  Sequence {
    Fetch(service: "entrypoint") {
      {
        test {
          __typename
          id
        }
      }
    },
    Flatten(path: "test") {
      Fetch(service: "monolith") {
        {
          ... on T {
            __typename
            id
          }
        } =>
        {
          ... on T {
            data1
            data2
          }
        }
      },
    },
  },
}

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Override Combination #1: ["percent(50)"]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
...
```

### `plan-one` command

Plans a query plan for supergraph schema, query and override conditions.

```
Usage: qp-analyzer plan-one [OPTIONS] <SCHEMA> <QUERY> [OVERRIDE_CONDITIONS]...

Arguments:
  <SCHEMA>                  Path to the supergraph schema file
  <QUERY>                   Path to the query file, `-` for stdin
  [OVERRIDE_CONDITIONS]...  Override conditions labels

Options:
      --override-all
          Override all conditions (equivalent to specifying all labels)
      --json
          Output results in JSON format
      --disable-generate-query-fragments
          Disable optimization of subgraph fetch queries using fragments
      --disable-defer-support
          Disable defer support
      --experimental-type-conditioned-fetching
          Enable type conditioned fetching
      --experimental-plans-limit <EXPERIMENTAL_PLANS_LIMIT>
          Sets a limit to the number of generated query plans [default: 10000]
      --experimental-paths-limit <EXPERIMENTAL_PATHS_LIMIT>
          Specify a per-path limit to the number of options considered. No limit is applied by default. Also, if set to `0`, it is treated as no limit [default: 0]
```

Notes on `OVERRIDE_CONDITIONS`:

* All arguments following the `<QUERY>` argument are considered override labels.
* If one or more override labels are provided, `@override` directives with the specified labels
  will take effect.
* If no labels are provided, none of the `@override` directives will take effect.
* If `--override-all` option is used, it is equivalent to specifying all override labels as
`OVERRIDE_CONDITIONS` arguments.

#### Example

```
% qp-analyzer plan-one example/supergraph.graphql example/op.graphql 'percent(50)' 'percent(90)'
```
```
% qp-analyzer plan-one example/supergraph.graphql example/op.graphql --override-all
